Console logging is an essential tool for developers. Let's explore some advanced techniques to enhance debugging and code development using the `console.log()` function. We'll cover **color coding**, **information grouping**, and **time measurement**.

## Using Colors to Distinguish Messages

When debugging code and wanting to highlight specific messages, you can apply styles to the `console.log()` function. Write the code as follows to apply color and style to your messages:

```js
const message = 'hello world';
console.log(
  `%c${message}`,
  'padding: 4px 8px; background: #C2E0C6; color: #000000;',
);
```

Here, `%c` is a special placeholder that allows you to apply CSS styles. In the above code, the message is displayed with a lime green background and black text. You can make your messages stand out by applying the necessary styles.

## Grouping Information

To logically group multiple pieces of information and display them in a structured way, you can use `console.groupCollapsed()` and `console.groupEnd()` functions.

```js {1,6}
console.groupCollapsed('[Grouped Information]');

console.log('>>> location', window.location);
console.log('>>> Astro', window.Astro);

console.groupEnd();
```

This helps to structure complex log messages, making it easier to understand the flow of code execution.

## Measuring Time

Measuring time helps in precisely timing the execution of code blocks and assessing performance. The following code allows you to measure the execution time of a code block:

```jsx {2,4}
(async () => {
  console.time();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  console.timeEnd();
})();
```
