When developing components with Svelte, there are often situations where you need to pass HTML Element's class attributes to other components. However, a straightforward approach can lead to issues.

```svelte
<script>
  export let class = "";
  // 🚨 Parsing error: 'class' is not allowed as a variable declaration name. eslint
  // 🚨 Variable declaration not allowed at this location. ts(1440)
</script>
```

The error occurs because `class` is a JavaScript [declaration command](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) used to create class objects. It's not meant to be used as a variable! This is similar to why React uses className instead of class.

Using `className` as below can lead to inconsistency and mistakes when using components:

```svelte
<script>
  export let className = '';
</script>

<Button className=""></Button>
<!-- I have to use className for my components..? -->
<button class=""></button>
```

To solve this, a bit of know-how is needed. Let's look at two methods.

## Method 1: `className`

In the component, alias `className` as `class` and export it.

```svelte
<script>
  let className = '';
  export { className as class };
</script>

<div {...$$restProps} class={className}>...</div>
```

Advantages

- It's declarative.
  - Intuitive and good for reusing variables.

Disadvantages

- The syntax can seem a bit unfamiliar.
- The code is longer. ~~Not very elegant.~~

## Method 2: `$$props.class`

Svelte's `$$props` is a special variable that contains all properties passed to the component. It can be used to easily handle the `class` attribute.

```svelte
<div {...$$restProps} class={$$props.class}>...</div>
```

Advantages

- The code is concise.

Disadvantages

- There are constraints on where `$$restProps` can be used.
- ```svelte
  <div class="btn {$$props.class}" {...$$restProps}>...</div>
  <!-- 🚨 The `class` attribute in `$$restProps` remains, overriding the original content. -->
  ```

## In Conclusion

As always in coding, there is no single right answer.
You can establish conventions that suit your development environment and team's preferences. Try out the examples on [svelte REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/4fb8404156a34bb4b9bc2416abf6cd7b?version=4.2.7), and refer to open-source codes to make your decision!
