I've decided to _redesign_ my passionately crafted ["personal blog"](https://bepyan.github.io/) before it even turned a year old. I want to document this process candidly.

## Rediscovering What I Want to Do

This quote has been a guiding beacon since joining Kakao. Busy with life, this reminder helped me rediscover what I truly want to do.

I yearn to create something **simple, clear, smooth, and relaxed**. I want these qualities to become a sort of **brand identity** in everything I touch, and my self-built blog seemed the perfect canvas for this expression.

## Reflecting on My Previous Blog

Hence, I felt compelled to revisit my [previous blog](https://bepyan.github.io/).

It was a piece made with great effort, and I was satisfied with its softness. However, I sensed an underlying **discomforting complexity**.

There were several areas of dissatisfaction:

- The wide gaps between contents led to easy distraction and fatigue.
- The narrow space between the title and text felt claustrophobic.
- The content was skewed to the left, making consumption burdensome.
- The code highlighting differed from vscode, reducing immersion.
- The variety in font sizes and styles made the UI feel cluttered.
- ...

I longed for an extremely simplified screen.

## Redesigning the Blog

Just then, I stumbled upon some inspiring figures during my commutes, discovered through Twitter. [_Paco Coursey_](https://paco.me/), [_Rauno_](https://rauno.me/), and [_Anthony Fu_](https://antfu.me/) gave me abundant inspiration. I was burning with passion to create a stunning blog like theirs.

The first step was the ["Next.js 13 app directory transition"](https://github.com/bepyan/bepyan.me).

- Curiosity about the then-new app directory.
- Taking cues from the robust Next.js 13 project structure of [`shadcn/ui`](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui).
- Implementing [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/), a more vscode-like syntax highlighter based on [`shiki`](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).
- Emulating the sophisticated simple layouts of these artisans.
- ...

This led me to rethink **content** as well.

- I wanted to more clearly distinguish between writings containing my thoughts and opinions and those conveying information.
- This differentiation gave birth to [Writing](https://bepyan.me/writing) and [Note](https://bepyan.me/note).
- The process involved diligent development → recording discoveries in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) → composing content into articles.

By July and August, the blog had taken shape.

Addressing each dissatisfaction brought immense peace of mind. Particularly, the [example post](https://bepyan-me.vercel.app/posts/example) page was very satisfying. It rekindled my desire to write.

I kept the [source code](https://github.com/bepyan/bepyan.me) public, hoping it might help someone.

## Transitioning to Astro

However, I quickly decided to move platforms. I wanted to include not just writings but also interesting things like [dnd-playground](https://github.com/bepyan/dnd-playground) (**crafts**). Although I was eagerly using `Svelte` at work and wanted to tinker with it, `Next.js` focused on `React`, making it challenging to handle code in various languages.

Then, a colleague introduced me to [`Astro`](https://astro.build/).

- Optimized for **content delivery**, it's just fast.
- Framework-level support for `markdown` settings.
- More intuitive handling of `html`.
- Easy integration of different languages through [`Astro Islands`](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).

I thought, **"This is it."** It felt like the pinnacle of `MPA`. If Brunch were to be migrated to a new framework, Astro seemed highly appealing. ~Though that day might never come.~

Thus, the work began, and by September and October, the blog was newly revamped. I plan to write a separate post about this experience.

That's how the [Craft](https://bepyan.me/craft) section was added to the blog.
Additionally, I used the trending [`bun`](https://bun.sh/package-manager) as the package manager for the first time. It was noticeably fast.

Furthermore, I added my philosophy and details about the post layout to the [example post](/post/example).

## Finally Purchasing a Domain

I bought the domain from [Gabia](https://www.gabia.com/). Compared to other sites, it seemed cheaper and the UI cleaner. I paid 70,000 won for 3 years, considering it like buying a jacket.

Honestly, I was a bit scared to connect a service to a domain for the first time.
But `vercel` was a godsend.
Just pasting the DNS info immediately connected the domain.

## In Conclusion

Maintaining a technical blog really seems impossible without true love for it. I must continually confront my feelings to maintain this affection. "What do you want to do with your blog?"
