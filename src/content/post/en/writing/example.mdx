**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language based on plain text. It's used for writing formatted documents in plain text and is known for its easy and simple syntax compared to traditional markup languages.

This post documents how I utilize Markdown in this blog.

## Minimalism

As a frontend developer, I want to convey something through layout.
**I hope the text feels comfortable to the reader.**

That's why I value the **beauty of whitespace**.
Pages crammed with content make reading unpleasant. I often leave a page after just glancing at the title.

Here are some hidden details of the layout:

- The **size of the title and the body text is the same.**
  - This avoids a feeling of disconnect between characters and brings calmness upon accessing the page.
  - The text feels straightforward, reminiscent of reading a book.
- The spacing between paragraphs is **wide.**
  - It gives a breathing space.
  - It helps focus more on the current paragraph.
- The top area of the page is **left empty.**
  - This draws the eyes towards the center of the page where the text is.
- The color of the body text is notably **light.**
  - Titles and bold text are easily recognized.
  - Important content is quickly identifiable.

### Titles

This blog uses only `h2` and `h3` titles.
It’s to maintain the **beauty of Semantic HTML**. ~~(Occupational hazard)~~

- `h1` already exists as it represents `the highest-level heading on the page`.
- `h4` is a crime in itself. It's evidence of a complex piece of writing.

## Basic Elements

> Quotations use [Serif typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif).
> Even the font itself makes the quoted text seem significant!

_Serif_ typeface can be used within the text too.
However, it's not recommended as it disrupts the balance of the text.

`<mark></mark>` can be used to <mark>highlight text</mark>.

[Links](/) have a subtle underline and minimal `hover` effects.
[**Bold links**](/) are more eye-catching.
[External links](https://bepyan.me/) generate an icon indicating "a new tab will open."
https://github.com/bepyan By default, links are automatically parsed.

The division line is subtle and not too prominent.
It's not frequently used as there's enough spacing overall.

## Code Blocks

`inline code` `[1, 2, 3]{:js}`

```
Block code
```

```ts twoslash
import clsx, { type ClassValue } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      msg: 'Focused!', // [!code focus]
    };
  },
};
```

```tsx line-numbers title="layout.tsx" caption="Like a poor star, that's why, the bug, left behind." /fontMono/ /fontSans/ /fontSerif/
import '~/styles/globals.css';

import type { Metadata } from 'next';

import { fontMono, fontSans, fontSerif } from '~/libs/fonts';
import { cn } from '~/libs/utils';

console.log('highlight'); // [!code highlight]
console.log('goodbye'); // [!code --]
console.log('hello'); // [!code ++]

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="ko" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body
        className={cn(
          'bg-background min-h-screen font-sans antialiased',
          fontSans.variable,
          fontSerif.variable,
          fontMono.variable,
        )}
      >
        <div className="blur" aria-hidden="true"></div>
        <div className="max-w-page container mx-auto pt-32">
          <div className="main-grid">{children}</div>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2540
interface Todo {
  title: string;
}

const todo: Readonly<Todo> = {
  title: 'Delete inactive users'.toUpperCase(),
  //  ^?
};

todo.title = 'Hello';

Number.parseInt('123', 10);
//      ^|

// @log: Custom log message
const a = 1;
// @error: Custom error message
const b = 1;
// @warn: Custom warning message
const c = 1;
// @annotate: Custom annotation message
```
